<p>The scholarly and cultural record is now a hybrid material reality: parts analog and part digital. Vast commodified libraries and small, carefully curated collections of digitized historical artifacts are now common sources for our research; most of our writing for publication happens directly in the computer, with print being an after-effect; the venues themselves for such publications is itself the online world. An enormous amount of data now carry our cultures and histories. This data as such can also be manipulated using algorithms, often to detect patterns in corpora, at other times to create new knowledges and even convincing falsehoods; powerful networking tools accompany a renewed attention to acknowledged collaboration, outside of service and clientelist relationship in the production of knowledge. Digital scholarship speaks of this brave new world, and the material objects and architectures that enable our movements through it.</p>

<p>Or how aboutâ€¦ the combination of the digital archives we use for our research, and the wondrous new forms our research and publications can take through and with our computational devices. That sounds right.</p>

<h3 id="why-is-my-project-not-here">Why is my project not here?</h3>

<p>This directory was compiled over a period of over a month by a <a href="http://localhost:4000/caridischo/credits/">group of our colleagues</a>â€”librarians and scholars. These colleagues heard about the directory through social media networks and word of mouth. We did our best to promote the collection of data in order to make sure that most of you knew we were building a directory. We donâ€™t know why your project is not here.</p>

<h3 id="so-how-do-i-add-my-project">So how do I add my project?</h3>

<p>The website for this directory was built as a static, finite site by design. The site is not meant to be updated continously. We decided to do this because of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200326054116/https://des4div.library.northeastern.edu/design-for-diversity-the-case-of-ed-alex-gil/">our gravitation towards minimal computing practices</a>, but also because of the history of project directories in the larger world of digital humanities. Simply put, weâ€™re dealing here with Walter Benjaminâ€™s angel of history: nothing but disaster has befallen most previous attempts at building these comprehensive, exhaustive, always-open-for-business databases of projects.</p>

<p>Do not despair, though.</p>
