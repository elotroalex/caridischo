<p>The scholarly and cultural record is now a hybrid material reality—parts analog, parts digital. Vast commodified libraries and small, carefully-curated collections of digitized historical and cultural artifacts are now commonplace sources for our research; most of our writing for publication happens directly in and for the computer, with print being an after-effect; the venues themselves for such publications is increasingly online and opened. An enormous amount of data now carry our cultures and histories as a result. This data, as such, can be manipulated using algorithms, often to detect patterns in corpora, at other times to create new knowledge, even convincing falsehoods; powerful networking tools seem to fuel a new kind of acknowledged collaboration, outside of service and clientelist relationships in the production and hoarding of knowledge. Digital scholarship speaks of this brave new world, and the material objects and architectures that enable our movements through it.</p>

<h3 id="cant-you-just-give-it-to-me-straight">Can’t you just give it to me straight?</h3>

<p>Sure. How about… The digital archives we use and produce for our research; and, the new forms our research, teaching and publishing through and with our computational devices.</p>

<h3 id="why-is-my-project-not-here">Why is my project not here?</h3>

<p>This directory was compiled over a period of over a month by a <a href="http://localhost:4000/caridischo/credits/">group of our colleagues</a>—librarians and scholars. These colleagues heard about the directory through social media networks and word of mouth. We did our best to promote the collection of data in order to make sure that most of you knew we were building a directory. We don’t know why your project is not here.</p>

<h3 id="so-how-do-i-add-my-project">So… how do I add my project?</h3>

<p>The website for this directory was built as a static, finite site by design. The site is not meant to be updated continously. We decided to do this because of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200326054116/https://des4div.library.northeastern.edu/design-for-diversity-the-case-of-ed-alex-gil/">our gravitation towards minimal computing practices</a>, but also because of the history of project directories in the larger world of digital humanities. Simply put, we’re dealing here with Walter Benjamin’s angel of history: nothing but disaster has befallen most previous attempts at building these comprehensive, exhaustive, always-open-for-business databases of projects.</p>

<p>Do not despair, though. We are keeping <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PfgI0GrQR60gwRFVIZmZtWae9JyAMpZNFOZRe5xsMsg/edit#gid=0">our base data sheet on Google docs</a> open and available to everyone. A new column was added that asks for the year a new entry was added. We have discussed building a new directory a few years from now, for a future Caribbean Digital conference. Who knows. Perhaps we’re starting a tradition.</p>

<h3 id="i-found-a-serious-error-in-your-data-who-do-i-talk-to">I found a serious error in your data. Who do I talk to?</h3>

<p>If the error is truly serious, talk to Alex Gil. He takes full responsibility for the contents of this site and its mistakes and misfortunes.</p>

<h3 id="what-goes-good-with-rum">What goes good with rum?</h3>

<p>Ice. Maybe a little lime.</p>
