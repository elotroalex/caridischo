<p>The scholarly and cultural record is now a hybrid material reality: parts analog and part digital. Vast commodified libraries and small, carefully curated collections of digitized historical artifacts are now common sources for our research; most of our writing for publication happens directly in the computer, with print being an after-effect; the venues themselves for such publications is itself the online world. An enormous amount of data now carry our cultures and histories. This data as such can also be manipulated using algorithms, often to detect patterns in corpora, at other times to create new knowledges and even convincing falsehoods; powerful networking tools accompany a renewed attention to acknowledged collaboration, outside of service and clientelist relationship in the production of knowledge. Digital scholarship speaks of this brave new world, and the material objects and architectures that enable our movements through it.</p>

<p>Or how aboutâ€¦ the combination of the digital archives we use for our research, and the wondrous new forms our research and publications can take through and with our computational devices. That sounds right.</p>
