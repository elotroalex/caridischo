<p>All of our entries were compiled during one of the out-of-synch events that defined <a href="http://caribbeandigitalnyc.net/2020/directory/">The Caribbean Digital VII</a> conference. We shared a Google Spreadsheet with our colleagues on social media and on our site. Soon after many joined us adding their own projects or the projects they knew about.</p>

<p>We are certainly not the first to compile a similar list. Here are some other useful attempts, that in turn served as sources for CariDiScho:</p>
