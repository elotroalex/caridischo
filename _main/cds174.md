blurb: The Haitian American Dream examines the events and the forgotten stories of
  Haitian immigrants in the United States. In so doing, it explains the reasons behind
  the different waves of Haitian migration, its ongoing impacts, and upheavals so
  that, as Michel-Rolph Trouillot states, the stories of “the actors who participate
  in the production of history or any of the sites where that production” transpired
  are told.
