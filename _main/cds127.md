blurb: This animated thematic map narrates the spatial history of the greatest slave
  insurrection in the eighteenth century British Empire. To teachers and researchers,
  the presentation offers a carefully curated archive of key documentary evidence.
  To all viewers, the map suggests an argument about the strategies of the rebels
  and the tactics of counterinsurgency, about the importance of the landscape to the
  course of the uprising, and about the difficulty of representing such events cartographically
  with available sources.
