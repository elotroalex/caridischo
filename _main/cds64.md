blurb: 'In the Same Boats is a work of multimodal scholarship designed to encourage
  the collaborative production of humanistic knowledge within scholarly communities.
  The platform comprises two interactive visualizations that trace the movements of
  significant cultural actors from the Caribbean and wider Americas, Africa, and Europe
  within the 20th century Afro-Atlantic world. It presents opportunities for unearthing
  the extent to which Caribbean, Latin American, African, European, and Afro-American
  intellectuals have been in both punctual and sustained conversation with one another:
  attending the same conferences, publishing in the same journals and presses, active
  in the same political groups, perhaps even elbow-to-elbow in the same Parisian cafés
  and on the same transatlantic crossings––literally and metaphorically in the same
  boats––as they circulate throughout the Americas, Africa, Europe, and beyond.'
