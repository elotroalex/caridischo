blurb: 'The former French colony of Saint-Domingue (in present-day Haiti) was one
  of the most brutal – as well as one of the most lucrative – Caribbean slave colonies.
  Saint-Domingue was also home to the most extensive public theatre tradition in the
  eighteenth-century Caribbean. Despite the excellent work of a small number of researchers,
  theatre in Saint-Domingue remains relatively little-known today. Without overlooking
  the extraordinary violence and cruelty of contemporary Saint-Dominguan society,
  this website and database seek to make known the rich and varied culture of public
  theatre as documented in the local newspapers between 1764 (when local print production
  began) and 1791 (the beginning of the slave revolts that would lead to the Haitian
  Revolution), and to promote further research in this area. '
