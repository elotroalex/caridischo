blurb: Moko is a non-profit journal that publishes fiction, poetry, visual arts, and
  non-fiction essays that reflect a Caribbean heritage or experience. We were founded
  in 2013 with a goal to create networks with a pan-Caribbean ethos in a way that
  is also sensitive to our location within the Virgin Islands. We embrace diversity
  of experience and self-expression. Moko seeks submissions from both established
  and emerging writers, artists, and scholars. We are interested in work that encourages
  questioning of our societies and ourselves. We encourage you to submit your best
  work to us whether it be new visual art, fiction, poetry, reviews, interviews, or
  essays on any topic relevant to the Caribbean experience. We publish in May and
  November.
