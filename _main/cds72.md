blurb: The UCLA Library has launched an innovative and forward-looking initiative
  to capture ephemeral content with global partners. Through this project, UCLA Library
  endeavors to build international and global collections of knowledge and to preserve
  the historical and cultural record so that present and future generations can access
  and use ephemera that document the larger arena of discourse that takes place alongside
  mainstream media and scholarly publications.
