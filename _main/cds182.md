blurb: '"I Am Taíno" is a portrait series addressing paper genocide and the manipulation
  of Taíno identity. The Taíno are the indigenous peoples of the Spanish-speaking
  Caribbean who were believed to be extinct up until recently, partly because the
  racial category for being indigenous ("indio") was removed from census reports in
  the early 1800s, and they were forced to identify as either white, black or mixed
  on forthcoming census reports. The Taíno refer to this process as "paper genocide."'
