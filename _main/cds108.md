blurb: This Making of Caribbean Feminisms project is founded on the belief that the
  impulse to further feminist theorising and activism needs to be transmitted to a
  younger generation. One of the outcomes has been the creation of a Special Collection
  on Caribbean Feminisms which is now housed in the West Indiana and Special Collections
  section and the UWISpace online archives of The UWI Alma Jordan Library, St. Augustine
  Campus
