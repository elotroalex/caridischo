blurb: The Keywords for Caribbean Studies project launched in December 2020 as part
  of The Caribbean Digital VII. This collaborative digital project aims to build a
  collection of words that serve as rich sites for research and pedagogy in Caribbean
  studies. Modeled on Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities, the Keywords for Caribbean
  Studies collection is intended to be the beginning of a project that will grow with
  future Caribbean Digital events each year. It is our hope that the project will
  not so much concretize and “fix” ideas of what is important in Caribbean studies
  but, rather, open avenues for questioning the central nodes of scholarly inquiry
  and teaching about the Caribbean across disciplines.
