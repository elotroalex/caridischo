blurb: 'Architecture of Necessity is a concept with a double function. It initially
  operates as a descriptive and austere term in its rhetorical value that points to
  an architecture of urgency and precariousness. Its second and most important function
  is metaphorical: it enunciates an architecture that is its own diagram.'
