blurb: The trading of Africans who were forced into slavery was the ‘core business’
  of the MCC (The Middelburgse Commercie Compagnie). From 1732 to 1807, 31.095 African
  slaves were bought by the MCC with the intention to sell them in the West Indies.
  The archive of the MCC is kept by the Zeeland Archives and is included on UNESCO’s
  World Heritage List.
