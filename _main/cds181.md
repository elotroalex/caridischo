blurb: The Indigenous Caribbean Center was formerly, for 10 years, the Caribbean Amerindian
  Centrelink. As part of its 10th anniversary, a renaming and restructuring of the
  site took place, to better reflect contemporary meanings and indigenous self-representations
  in the region and its diaspora, to allow for greater collaboration among the contributors
  to the site, and to permit users to post comments and questions on each page and
  article in the site. The editorial structure has changed as well, in that there
  is no longer an “editor in chief” and no official webmaster. Finally, the plain
  text mirror site of the CAC was also deleted.
