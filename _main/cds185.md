blurb: Ro(u)ted By Our Stories is an intergenerational oral history archive dedicated
  to capturing, preserving and sharing the stories of the Indo-Caribbean diaspora's
  silenced voices. This archive works to center the stories of womxn and gender expansive
  folx at various intersections of identity including but not limited to those who
  identify as LGBTQIA+, mixed-race, Muslim, and/or working class. It is a living,
  growing archive of stories from communities who have inherited the legacies of indenture,
  rooted in histories and traditions of oral storytelling. In the tradition of Indo-Caribbean
  feminist thinkers and inspired by the work of diasporic writers like Paul Gilroy,
  we are inspired to document our heritage (“roots”) but also our migration stories
  (“routes”)
