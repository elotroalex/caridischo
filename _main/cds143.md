blurb: 'From his office and studios on the fifth floor of &quot; The Freedom Tower&quot;  in
  Miami, Italian-American businessman Louis J. Boeri and his company, America''s Productions,
  Inc. (API), formed a radio programming empire, selling their shows to government,
  to more than 200 radio stations throughout Latin America and Spain, and to Spanish-speaking
  radio stations in the United States during the second half of the 1960s. With scripts
  written by acclaimed exiled Cuban screenwriters and Mexican writers, America''s
  Productions, Inc. produced two types of programs: the first with political content
  and the second, of a more general nature, distinguished as &quot; pure entertainment.&quot;  Designed
  for a Latin American and Latino audience residing in the US, the pure entertainment
  included radio soap operas / dramas, comedies, advice and self-help programs, biblical
  dramas, mysteries, spy stories, and variety shows.'
