blurb: The literature of the Caribbean is exceptional, both in language and subject.
  More than a million and a half Africans, along with many Indians and South Asians,
  were brought to the Caribbean between the 15th and 19th centuries. Today, their
  descendants are active in literature and the arts, producing literature with strong
  and direct ties to traditional African expressions. This literary connection, combined
  with the tales of survival, exile, resistance, endurance, and emigration to other
  parts of the Americas, makes for a body of work that is essential for the study
  of the Caribbean and the Black Diasporaâ€”and indeed central for our understanding
  of the New World.
