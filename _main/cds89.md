blurb: Colonial slavery shaped modern Britain and we all still live with its legacies.
  The slave-owners were one very important means by which the fruits of slavery were
  transmitted to metropolitan Britain. We believe that research and analysis of this
  group are key to understanding the extent and the limits of slavery's role in shaping
  British history and leaving lasting legacies that reach into the present. The stories
  of enslaved men and women, however, are no less important than those of slave-owners,
  and we hope that the database produced in the first two phases of the project, while
  at present primarily a resource for studying slave-owners, will also provide information
  of value to those researching enslaved people.
