blurb: "The Puerto Rico Architectural Historic Archive will be an online digital repository
  of\r\narchitectural resources, whether documents, photographs, buildings and sites
  in Puerto\r\nRico. PRAHA is an alliance of six organizations that share a commitment
  towards the\r\nconservation of architectural heritage: 1. public and private; Fundación
  Luis Muñoz\r\nMarín (FLMM), Para la Naturaleza, and the Puerto Rico Historic Buildings
  Drawings\r\nSociety (PRHBDS) and 2. state and federal entities; the National Park
  Service (NPS),\r\nthe State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO), the Archivo de
  Arquitectura y\r\nConstrucción de la Universidad de Puerto Rico (AACUPR). Our goal
  is to share\r\ntechnological infrastructure and distributed meta data across our
  six organizations to\r\nfurther promote the visibility of our collective resources.
  Without the acknowledgement\r\nof Vernacular, Afro Puerto Rican, rural, and barrio
  architecture, a panoramic view of the\r\nhistory and definition of architecture
  as a cultural product remains incomplete. In this\r\nproject, such a stance will
  translate into the visualization, through photographic records,\r\nof architectural
  styles, dwelling systems, and the working spaces of/for the historically\r\nmarginalized
  and silenced social groups."
