blurb: Our digital forum for innovative critical and creative explorations of Caribbean
  literature, broadly defined. Caribbean creative writing has always wrestled with
  the idea of an aesthetic form that engages regional and diasporic understandings
  of our changing realities. As a forum, sx salon aims to stimulate these sensibilities
  and preoccupations across different literary genres. Initiated in 2010, sx salon
  appears three times per year (February, June, and October). We publish literary
  discussions, interviews with writers, reviews of new publications (creative and
  scholarly), and poetry and prose by Caribbean writers.
