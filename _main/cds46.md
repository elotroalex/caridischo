  seminar. The site has evolved since fall 2015 and been reworked for the Scalar platform;
  it now offers digital editions of all of McKay’s early poems, including Songs of
  Jamaica, Constab Ballads, Spring in New Hampshire, and Harlem Shadows, as well as
  uncollected poetry published in various Jamaican, British, and American magazines
  from the 1910s and 20s not included in those volumes.
