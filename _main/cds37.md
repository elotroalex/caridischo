blurb: The Caribbean Review of Gender Studies stimulates cross-cultural exchanges
  among Caribbean peoples within the region, those in the Caribbean Diaspora, as well
  as those who bring a comparative perspective to bear on Caribbean gender and feminist
  concerns. The journal is established around an identity and voice emanating from
  Caribbean realities of power in gender, sexualities, ethnicity and class relations,
  and their effects. The journal welcomes critical disciplinary or multi-disciplinary
  scholarly articles and creative contributions that broaden networks and enhance
  the global understanding and reach of Caribbean feminist theory and praxis.
