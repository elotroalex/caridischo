blurb: "‘Fanm Rebèl’, a Haitian Kreyòl term meaning ‘rebel women’, is a 3-year research
  project sponsored by the Leverhulme Trust and the Institute for Black Atlantic Research
  at the University of Central Lancashire. Led by Dr Nicole Willson, the project seeks
  to excavate stories of women in the Haitian Revolution. Spanning a 100-year trajectory,
  from 1750-1850, it broadens the conventional scope of the Haitian revolutionary
  calendar to encompass the radical acts of female insurgency and marronage that predate
  the Ogé Rebellion of 1790 and the insurgency of 1791, and extends beyond the birth
  of the Haitian Republic in 1804 to encompass the life cycle of Marie-Louise Christophe,
  first Queen of Haiti. It explores narratives of resistance articulated through spiritual
  practice, domestic labour, creativity, survival, subterfuge and armed combat. "
