blurb: Welcome to the Haitian History Blog, a space dedicated to discussions on Haiti’s
  political history. “Political history” here can be understood in a broad sense,
  one that encompasses questions relating to society, governance, intellectual history
  and foreign relations forged between Haiti and its neighbours in the Americas.
