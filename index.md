## A Directory of Caribbean Digital Scholarship.

Welcome. On this website you can browse and search an open-source bibliography of digital resources resulting from---and meant for---the study of the Caribbean. Here you will learn more about the contours of our Caribbean scholarly and cultural record online. All of our entries were compiled during one of the out-of-synch events that defined [The Caribbean Digital VII](http://caribbeandigitalnyc.net/2020/directory/) conference. Akin to a census, this directory takes a snapshot of our record up to the end of 2020. To learn more about the project please consult our "[Frequently Asked Questions]({{site.baseurl}}/about/)," or simply begin exploring.
