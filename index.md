## A Directory of Caribbean Digital Scholarship.

On this website you can browse and search an open-source bibliography of digital resources resulting from---and meant for---the study of the Caribbean. Here you will learn more about the contours of our Caribbean scholarly and cultural record online. All of our entries were compiled during one of the out-of-synch events that defined [The Caribbean Digital VII](http://caribbeandigitalnyc.net/2020/directory/) conference in 2020. Akin to a census, this directory is a snapshot of our times. To learn more about the project please consult our "FAQ," or simply begin exploring. Below you can browse through all the entries. You can also explore the different genres of digital scholarship individually in the top nav bar. Welcome.
