We even have our own encyclopedias and dictionaries, as one should. A strange, more complete set of "Tl√∂n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius," *EcuRed* includes what Wikipedia lives out. So does *The Caribbean Dictionary*. Reference built by us will always reflect our own worlds in a manner that the universalists cannot. A reference work is always a series of breadcrumbs, a shout out that points us to that which is unique, and may be ours.

This directory is itself a reference work, and so are the bibliographies and syllabi listed below. The *Puerto Rico Syllabus,* as all syllabi, is a bibliography in its own right---curated for students, for the public---curated in the era of automatically generated bibliographies, from Google to library keyword searches.
