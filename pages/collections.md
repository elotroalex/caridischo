In *Silencing the Past*, Michel-Rolph Trouillot reminds us that the past exists in its material traces, and that those material traces are produced---our past is a product, and so are its consequences. He goes on to place power at the center of that production: “inequalities experienced by the actors lead to uneven historical power in the inscription of traces… Sources are thus instances of inclusion, the other face of which is, of course, what is excluded” (p.48).

We are now experiencing a new, intense round of (re-)production of that past in the form of large and small digital libraries. We see the careful curation of texts in rich scholarly editions online, as well as shoddy mass digitization; we see profitable knowledge cartels produce substantial "databases" of remediated archival sources, available for rent, like Netflix for solvent research institutions; we see libraries, large and small, try to catch up by offering their own holdings open-access; we see shadow libraries, the gigantic ones produced with the pirate care of Eastern Europeans, as well as the handheld ones of Cuban sneakernets; in our Caribbean, we have the honor of enjoying one of the largest digital libraries of any region of the world, [dLoC]({{'/caridischo/cds31/'|absolute_url}}), as well as many smaller thematic collections, carefully curated by the scholars who most care about them. The resulting artifacts of this archive-making, sampled below, lie somewhere in between the impulse to collect "the disjecta membra of this Great House" for profit or authority, and the impulse to curate, to care for our most precious household rebels.

### Digital Libraries

Larger digital libraries can be distinguished by the fact that they themselves hold many collections within them. They abide by a larger thematic gravity, be it the nations and territories of the Caribbean, or the region as a whole as the case of the Digital Library of the Caribbean.

### Thematic Curations

Not the cup of tea of surrealists, but very useful to the rest of us, thematic curatorial exercises respond to the nature of the broken documentary record. Themes---an author's work, evidence from a historic episode, and so on---are often found scattered across many libraries, or co-existing with others in a larger library. These are often accompanied by narratives in the form of exhibits, and increasingly explore the possibilities of the medium by adding visual, interactive browsing mechanisms. We find these curations in and outside our universities, produced by researchers, students, librarians, communities, and vendors---divsion of labor be damned. They are also the most common genre in the Caribbean Digital, and testify to the cultural richness of our Caribbean pasts.

### Scholarly Editions

Not all editions are made the same, and by extension, not all collections of documents. We give pride of place to the editorial work that enriches our literary and historical documents with scholarly research, and pays due attention to the materiality of our documentary record. Sometimes we counter-annotate, read against the grain, and other times we do so to celebrate. Either way, the call to care for the cultural and historical documents that tell the stories of our brutal colonization, resistance, life, justice and freedom is particularly poignant for our communities. We believe, following the lead of Kim Gallon's "[Making a Case for the Black Digital Humanities](https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled/section/fa10e2e1-0c3d-4519-a958-d823aac989eb)," that the "technologies of recovery" are central to the Caribbean Digital as well, and in this scholarly genre we find some of its most promising avenues.
