blurb: ARC Magazine is a non-profit print and online publication and social platform
  launched in 2011. It seeks to fill a certain void by offering a critical space for
  contemporary artists to present their work while fostering and developing critical
  dialogues and opportunities for crucial points of exchange, scholarship and study.
  ARC is an online and social space of interaction with a developed methodology of
  sharing information about contemporary practices, exhibitions, partnerships, and
  opportunities occurring in the Caribbean region and throughout its diasporas.
