blurb: The Caribbean Review of Books (CRB) is an online magazine covering Caribbean
  literature and arts. We focus on reviews of new and recent books of Caribbean fiction,
  poems, biography, arts, culture, and current affairs, but the CRB also publishes
  new writing, interviews, and essays on literature and culture. The CRB is currently
  on indefinite hiatus and not actively publishing new material.
