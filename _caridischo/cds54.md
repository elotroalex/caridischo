blurb: The first edition of The Sugar-Cane, a 168-page poem about eighteenth-century
  Caribbean sugar plantations, appeared in London in 1764. We have created one full-text
  version of the poem and a page-by-page reading experience, as well as excerpts that
  highlight counter-plantation themes within the poem.
