blurb: |-
  \"In many instances the revolutionary spirit can be only dimly perceived through the eye-witness accounts and recollections of literate white colonists and free people of color, but it is there all the same.

  The exhibition items have been chosen, and the captions written, so as to provide a running narrative of the Haitian Revolution.\"
