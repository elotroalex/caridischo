blurb: 'The New Netherland Institute is making available digitized versions of translations
  and transcriptions of documents relating to New Netherland. Written in an archaic
  hand, these seventeenth-century documents were damaged by fire and water, but they
  are our best source of knowledge about the former Dutch colony. Available on this
  website are government records held by the New York State Archives, private and
  corporate papers from the collections of the New York State Library, and selected
  documents from other repositories. Scanned originals of many of these documents
  are available on the websites of the New York State Archives and New York State
  Library. '
