blurb: The banjo has a rich history in the Caribbean, the region where we first find
  the traces of the instrument in the 17th century. Indeed, it seems that it is in
  the Caribbean that the instrument first emerged and was consolidated, for there
  is about a fifty year lag between the first sources we have describing the instrument
  in this region, from the 1680s, and those from North America, which are from the
  late 1730s. Here, we offer a few avenues for understanding the fascinating history
  of the banjo in the Caribbean.
