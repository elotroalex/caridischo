blurb: Mapping Marronage is an interactive visualization of the trans-Atlantic networks
  of intellectual, creative and political exchange created by enslaved people in the
  18th and 19th century. It traces the geographic reach, crossings and intersections
  of letters, testimonies and financial exchanges by enslaved people of African-descent.
