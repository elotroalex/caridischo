blurb: 'archipelagos is a born-digital, peer-reviewed publication devoted to creative
  exploration, debate, and critical thinking about and through digital practices in
  contemporary scholarly and artistic work in and on the Caribbean. Given the wide
  implications of the “digital turn” for our very conceptions of knowledge, our mission
  is to discern the ways in which the digital may enhance and transform our comprehension
  of the regional and diasporic Caribbean. archipelagos responds to this challenge
  with three distinct dimensions of critical production: scholarly essays; digital
  scholarship projects; and digital project reviews.'
