blurb: |-
  The Puerto Rico Architectural Historic Archive will be an online digital repository of
  architectural resources, whether documents, photographs, buildings and sites in Puerto
  Rico. PRAHA is an alliance of six organizations that share a commitment towards the
  conservation of architectural heritage: 1. public and private; Fundación Luis Muñoz
  Marín (FLMM), Para la Naturaleza, and the Puerto Rico Historic Buildings Drawings
  Society (PRHBDS) and 2. state and federal entities; the National Park Service (NPS),
  the State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO), the Archivo de Arquitectura y
  Construcción de la Universidad de Puerto Rico (AACUPR). Our goal is to share
  technological infrastructure and distributed meta data across our six organizations to
  further promote the visibility of our collective resources. Without the acknowledgement
  of Vernacular, Afro Puerto Rican, rural, and barrio architecture, a panoramic view of the
  history and definition of architecture as a cultural product remains incomplete. In this
  project, such a stance will translate into the visualization, through photographic records,
  of architectural styles, dwelling systems, and the working spaces of/for the historically
  marginalized and silenced social groups.
