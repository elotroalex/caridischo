blurb: The Slave Societies Digital Archive (formerly Ecclesiastical and Secular Sources
  for Slave Societies), directed by Jane Landers and hosted at Vanderbilt University,
  preserves endangered ecclesiastical and secular documents related to Africans and
  African-descended peoples in slave societies. SSDA holdings include more than 700,000
  digital images drawn close to 2,000 unique volumes dating from the sixteenth through
  twentieth centuries that document the lives of an estimated four to six million
  individuals. This collection contains the most extensive serial records for the
  history of Africans in the Atlantic World, and also includes valuable information
  about the indigenous, European, and Asian populations who lived alongside them.
