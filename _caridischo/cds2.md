blurb: During the height of the fascist Vichy regime in Martinique, Aimé Césaire was
  secretly at work on a forceful historical drama with the title \"...... Et les chiens
  se taisaient\"—\"...... and the Dogs Were Silent.\" The plot of the drama follows
  the events of the Haitian Revolution and the tragic destiny of its leader, Toussaint
  L’Ouverture, determined to die betrayed in a frozen cell in the Jura mountains rather
  than compromise his truth.
