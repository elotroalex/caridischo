blurb: During the height of the fascist Vichy regime in Martinique, Aimé Césaire was
  secretly at work on a forceful historical drama with the title &quot;...... Et les chiens
  se taisaient&quot;—&quot;...... and the Dogs Were Silent.&quot; The plot of the drama follows
  the events of the Haitian Revolution and the tragic destiny of its leader, Toussaint
  L’Ouverture, determined to die betrayed in a frozen cell in the Jura mountains rather
  than compromise his truth.
