blurb: During the height of the fascist Vichy regime in Martinique, Aimé Césaire was
  secretly at work on a forceful historical drama with the title &quot; ...... Et
  les chiens se taisaient&quot; —&quot; ...... and the Dogs Were Silent.&quot;  The
  plot of the drama follows the events of the Haitian Revolution and the tragic destiny
  of its leader, Toussaint L’Ouverture, determined to die betrayed in a frozen cell
  in the Jura mountains rather than compromise his truth.
