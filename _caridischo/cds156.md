blurb: In light of this obliteration of history, The Public Archive was initiated
  to serve as an accessible clearinghouse of historical essays, archival sources,
  and informed contemporary journalism on Haiti. The Public Archive compiles links
  to documents freely accessible through the digital collections of libraries and
  repositories as well as open-access online periodicals, academic journals and newspapers.
