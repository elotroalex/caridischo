blurb: "A timeline of events that explore the reasons behind the immigration of Cubans
  to Florida from the 16th to the 21st century, the pressure that such immigration
  brought to local and state governments, the reactions of Floridian communities to
  Cuban immigrants, the ways in which Cuban immigrants adapted to their new reality,
  and the contribution of Cuban immigration to Florida. \n"
