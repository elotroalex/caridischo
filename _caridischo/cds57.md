blurb: Based on a common need for a robust infrastructure to manage their digital
  cultural heritage, Hampshire, Mount Holyoke, and Smith colleges together launched
  the Compass digital repository in June 2017. Compass supports our institutional
  missions of teaching and research excellence through improved access to unique materials,
  and creates a resource to engage both scholars and the general public. The colleges
  have partnered with Born-Digital for development, design, and project management
  support.
