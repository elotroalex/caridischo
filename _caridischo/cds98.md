blurb: The La Gazette Royale project, which I first began to develop in 2014, is designed
  to gather together and in one place for the first time all of the known issues of
  the two newspapers published during Henry Christophe’s rule of northern Haiti, as
  well as the six different versions of the Almanach Royal d’Hayti issued by the royal
  press.
