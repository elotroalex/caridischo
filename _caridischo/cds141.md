blurb: This digital memorial raises questions about the largest slave trades in history
  and offers access to the documentation available to answer them. European colonizers
  turned to Africa for enslaved laborers to build the cities and extract the resources
  of the Americas. They forced millions of Africans across the Atlantic to the Americas,
  and from one part of the Americas to another. Analyze these slave trades and view
  interactive maps, timelines, and animations to see the dispersal in action.
