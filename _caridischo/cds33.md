blurb: The Carisealand (Caribbean Sea and Land) digital research project, launched
  in 2015 by scholar, teacher, and activist Schuyler K Esprit, provides an interactive
  framework within which to imagine a more sustainable way of life for Caribbean people,
  both in the present day and in the future. The project aims to create awareness
  around the impact of climate change in the Caribbean region; to initiate and sustain
  collaborations with scholars and artists in an effort to find solutions to social
  injustices resulting from climate change activity; and to present models for alternate
  Caribbean futures.
