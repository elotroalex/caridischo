blurb: In this project, Caribbean and Dutch scholars and cultural heritage specialists
  address these questions, identifying and questioning the dynamics of heritage formation,
  and developing a multi-generational human resource base as well as a digital infrastructure
  for the preservation of insular cultural heritage, for outreach activities, and
  ultimately for stimulating the sustainable development of these non-sovereign SIDS.
