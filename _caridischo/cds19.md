blurb: The word “revolution” is a human tool. At any point in time, its meaning has
  shifted to accommodate those wielding it. By establishing a site like this — Age
  of Revolutions — we are participating in the humanities, surveying revolutionary
  changes in history, encouraging the comparative study of revolutions, and exploring
  the hopes imbued in the term “revolution.”
