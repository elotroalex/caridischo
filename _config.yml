# COLLECTION SETTINGS
# --------------------------------------------------------------
# Wax leverages Jekyll collections for much of its
# functionality, therefor some of the keys below are from
# Jekyll while others are Wax-specific.
# For more info, refer to:
# ~> https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/

collections:
  exhibits:
    output: true
  caridischo: # name of collection
    output: true # makes sure pages are output as html files
    layout: 'caridischo_item' # the layout for the pages to use
    metadata:
      source: 'caridischo.csv' # path to the metadata file within `_data`
    images:
      source: 'raw_images/caridischo' # path to the directory of images within `_data`

# --------------------------------------------------------------
# LUNR SEARCH INDEX SETTINGS
# --------------------------------------------------------------
# You can create multiple lunr indexes below (though only one is
# recommended!) by specifying
# a `file` to write it to and some `collections` for it to index
# and running `$ bundle exec rake wax:lunr` .
# You can optionally generate a default UI by specifying a UI file
# and running `$ bundle exec rake wax:lunr UI=true`.

lunr_index:
  - file: 'assets/js/lunr-index.json' # file the index will get written to
    ui:   'assets/js/lunr-ui.js' # path to the search UI file
    collections:
      caridischo:
        content: false # whether or not to index page content
        fields: # the metadata fields to index
          - blurb
          - label

# --------------------------------------------------------------
# SITE MENU SETTINGS
# --------------------------------------------------------------
# Each menu item needs a `label` (whats shown), and a `link`

# submenu via `sub`.

    link: '/exhibits/a/'
